##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to cleanse and merge data taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by thirty volunteers performaing a series of tasks (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying).  Datasets of this measurement data have been taken in two stages, a train stage and a test stage.  This project merges the data and extracts the data for the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  Details regarding the experiment, measurement methods, and data preprocessing steps can be found at

##Raw Data Source
The raw data used for this project was downloaded from **https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip**, on February 02, 2015, 10:41:45 AM.

## Input Data Files
On downloading the data contained in the zip file, the following six (8) text files were extracted and used to process the data:

* activity_labels.txt - contains the codes used to identify the six activities examined during the experimental trials.  These codes were used to assign meaningful names to variables by converting the numeric code into a trial name.

* features.txt - contains a list of the 561 individual test measurements made during each trial. These features were used to determine the columns of interest in this analysis

* subject_train.txt - contains a list of the train subjects associated with each trial conducted during the training phase.  This data was used to assign a  subject field to each of the train records before merging data

* X_train.txt - contains the data measurements taken during each f the trials conducted during the training phase.

* y_train.txt - contains the order in which the activities were performed using the codes defined by in activity_labels.txt file. 

* subject_test.txt - contains a list of the test subjects associated with each trial conducted during the testing phase. This data was used to assign a subject field to each of the test records before merging data

* X_test.txt - contains the data measurements taken during each of the trials conducted during the testing phase.

* y_test.txt - contains the order in which the activities were performed using the codes defined by in activity_labels.txt file. 


##Processing Steps
In cleansing and preparing data for analysis, the process outlined in the following steps:  

###Creating Clean Test and Train Data Frames  
In Cleaning the data sets:  
1. The features.txt file was read in and used to label the columns of the data resulting from reading in the X_train.txt and the X_test.txt files.  This resulted in two tables each 562 columns wide (train_table and test_table).  
2. The y_test and y_train data were read and descriptive activity names were assigned  by converting the activity code to named factor using the contents of the activity_label.txt file.  These tables were then modified to add a column name of "Activity."  
3. The subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt files were read and the resulting tables were given a column name of "Subject."  
4. A Train data.frame was created by performing a column bind on subject_train_table, the y_train_table, and X_train_table.  The Test data frame was similiarly formed.  
5. The resulting data frames were then mutated to add a column entitled "Stage."  For the Train data frame this column contains the word "Train" and for the Test data frame the column contains the word "Test"

At this point two data frames entitled ("test_df" and "train_df") have been created each frame has 564 columns

### Merging The Data Frames and Extracting the Mean & STD Measurements  
The Test and Train data_frames were separately processed to extract the data related to mean and standard deviation by:  
1.  Extracting columns containing either of the phrase "Stage", "Activity"", mean" or "std" but not the phrase "freq."  This step reduced the number of columns from 564 down to 73
2.  The Test and Train data frames were joined to form a single data frame with 73 columns.  The following table describes the variable naming convention used: 
  
Col           |  Variable Name      | Variable Description 
--------------|---------------------|------------------------------  
1 | Stage              | Experimental stage when measurement was taken

### A TIDY data set was created
The resulting combined data frame was then processed to generat a Tidy data set containing the mean data for each activity by subject

The steps required to perform this transformation are provided in a separate R Program script entitled run_analysis.R.  
The script is included below:

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
